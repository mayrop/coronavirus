Hi! I'm [@mayrop](https://twitter/mayrop). There are tons of [limitations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP1nNqoHtcM) when trying to work with the datasets provided by the government about the Coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic in MÃ©xico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½. That is why I have been working in this project. The main goal is to publish the original data in an open format.

This site _is not official_. However, the published data used in this site are published by the SecretarÃ­a de Salud de MÃ©xico [@SSalud_mx](https://twitter/@SSalud_mx). All the details about how the data is being retrieved can be found in the [methodology](/docs/metodologia/) section ðŸ¤“.

This is not the only site that is working in something similar, there are many other [great sources](/docs/acerca/) out there that are working in a similar task.

{{< hint info >}}
**covid19in.mx** is one of the few sites that normalizes the information. Find more information about it [here](/docs/datos/tablas-casos/normalizacion/).

## Open Datasets
* [R Package](https://github.com/mayrop/r-covid19in-mx). (in construction) ðŸš§
* [Daily tables about open Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in MÃ©xico](/en/data/cases-tables/) ðŸ“‹
* [Time Series](/en/data/time-series/) ðŸ“ˆ
