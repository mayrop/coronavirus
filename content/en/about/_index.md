Hi! This project started on [March 28](https://github.com/mayrop/covid19in-mx/commit/d472d10cc7a7fad9b11099af8d5ee4f7dc07037c). The main goal is to make data available in an open format for the data analysis with respect to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemin in México. As it is mentioned in the [methodology section](/docs/metodologia/), the sources used in this site are the oficial sources, published by the [Secretaría de Salud de México](https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/informacion-internacional-y-nacional-sobre-nuevo-coronavirus-2019-ncov).

From the development side, the Python and R languages are used. All the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/mayrop/datos-covid19in-mx). The plots were done through [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/). 

If you find any error, or you have any suggestion to make this site better, or if you would like to contribute somehow, you can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mayrop).
